Implemention of paper : Magicmol - A light-weighted pipeline for drug-like molecule evolution and quick chemical space exploration https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2124702/v1

## Dataset 

Original ChEMBL30 (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) dataset, cleaned dataset is available at : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ULI0ZxBk26EiCw_p0LnLB1ckgstWK0Hq?usp=sharing


## Model Weight
The weight file is available at : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10LDOoQQzuL0XeDRdsWidhVsoN8W1wxFU?usp=sharing

Temporarily, model trained with SELFIES presentation is provided, and weight trained with SMILES will be available in the next few days.
However, we recommend you train the backbone model by yourself and leave it a cup of tea time (approximately 15 min on a single RTX3090) to finish the process (XD) to experience how fast the process is finished.

## But how to run ?
