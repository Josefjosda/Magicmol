# Data cleaning and preparation

## Training Data

Original ChEMBL30 (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) dataset, cleaned dataset are available at : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ULI0ZxBk26EiCw_p0LnLB1ckgstWK0Hq?usp=sharing

190W: Original Chembl-30 small molecule dataset

database.cleaned.smi / database.smi : pure SMILES data / SMILES data cleaned by clean.py  

database_smiles_0.25.pkl / database_smiles_0.5.pkl : random choosed 25% / 50% of the cleaned molecule data

# Data Cleaning
` python clean.py --in_path database.smi --out_path database_cleaned.smi  --vocab_path ../vocab/chembl_selfies_vocab.yaml `


## Model Weight
The weight file is available at : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10LDOoQQzuL0XeDRdsWidhVsoN8W1wxFU?usp=sharing

Update: Model trained with SMILES is provided also in the above link. 

However, we recommend you train the backbone model by yourself and leave it a cup of tea time (approximately 15 min on a single RTX3090) to finish this (XD) and experience how fast the process could be finished.

## But how to run ? 

Some modification is ongoing......
