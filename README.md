## Dataset 

Original ChEMBL30 (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) dataset, cleaned dataset are available at : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ULI0ZxBk26EiCw_p0LnLB1ckgstWK0Hq?usp=sharing


## Model Weight
The weight file is available at : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10LDOoQQzuL0XeDRdsWidhVsoN8W1wxFU?usp=sharing

Temporarily, model trained with SELFIES presentation is provided, and weight trained with SMILES will be available in the next few days.
However, we recommend you train the backbone model by yourself and leave it a cup of tea time (approximately 15 min on a single RTX3090) to finish the this (XD) to experience how fast the process is finished.

## But how to run ? 

Some modification is ongoing......
